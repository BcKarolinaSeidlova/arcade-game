# Arcade game
This project is part of Udacity nanodegree program (for Frontend web develompers). The code given by Udacity was edited by me, Karolina Seidlova.


## How to play the game
Used arrow keys to move your character, try to reach the water without crashing to bugs (your enemies) that will return to start position. To get better score, try to collect as much orange gems as you can!

You can change you character, it can be a boy (default look) or a girl or a princess.
Good luck!
