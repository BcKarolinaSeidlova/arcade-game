# Arcade game
This project is part of Udacity nanodegree program (for Frontend web develompers). The code given by Udacity was edited by me, Karolina Seidlova. File _js/app.js_ contains the code of the game, files _js/resources.js_ and _js/engine.js_ are provided by Udacity and contains code that runs the game (loading neccesary images and initializing game board).

## Requirements
**No special requirements needed. Just open the [link](https://bckarolinaseidlova.github.io/arcade-game/) in your browser and start to play.** 


## How to play the game
Used arrow keys to move your character up, down, left and right on the game board. The aim of the game is to reach the water without crashing to bugs (your enemies) that returns you to a start position. When you reach the water, you level up and your score is increased.

##Game tips
-  to get better score, try to collect as much orange gems as you can! Every gem add 100 points to your score.
- personalize your character, it can be a boy (default look) or a girl or a princess.
Good luck!
